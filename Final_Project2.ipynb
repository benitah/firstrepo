    "Every year, tens of thousands of cats and dogs end up in shelters.  We know many of them do not make it out.  What are some factors that increase likelihood of adoption?  What can we say about increasing the survival rate?  Taking data from 2008-2014, I have Intake and Outcome numbers by shelter, by year, and we will take a look at how health at intake, average income of the county the shelter resides in, and region of the US play a role in outcomes.

Other than a general sense of the awareness of hundreds (maybe thousands) of pets that are euthanized each year from the lack of having an owner or place to live, this is my first time deeply exploring animal shelter data.  I think my interest has already sparked the seeking of knowledge around the subject and am looking forward to discovering more."
